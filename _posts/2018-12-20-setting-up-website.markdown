This is a post describing how I set up this website utilizing various tools, including Github Pages and Jekyll. Given that I planned to post various programming tutorials and experiments, I was interested in using Pelican, as demonstrated in this [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/) as I read it is easier to integrate with Jupyter notebooks, but it seems Jekyll is just as fine.

I know there are many tutorials already out there on this, but to be honest, this is more of a reminder for me on how this blog was set up. Maybe in a future post, I will demonstrate how one can create interactive blog posts using Jupyter notebooks and nbinteract, which could be quite useful to many people.

Basically, I installed Ruby and RubyDevKit using the following [tutorial](https://martinbuberl.com/blog/install-ruby-for-windows/_) (I use Windows), and set up Jekyll using [this tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages). What follows is a step-by-step tutorial on what I did based on these tutorials.
